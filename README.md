## Introduction
Developing a portfolio project centered on a ride-sharing application like Ola or Uber showcases our skills in data structures and algorithms (DSA). These applications require efficient algorithms for tasks such as matching riders with drivers, optimizing routes, managing dynamic pricing, and tracking real-time locations. By implementing key DSA techniques, including graph algorithms, priority queues, and spatial indexing, you can demonstrate your ability to tackle complex, real-world problems with efficient and scalable solutions. 

## Objectives
1. Develop an algorithm to match riders with the nearest available drivers in real-time using priority queues.
2. Implement shortest path algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s or A* to optimize routes for drivers, reducing travel time and fuel consumption.
3. Create a dynamic pricing model that adjusts ride costs based on supply and demand, utilizing greedy algorithms or machine learning techniques.
4. Design a system to continuously update and track the location of vehicles using spatial data structures like quad trees.
5. Develop a scheduling algorithm that minimizes wait times for riders and maximizes driver efficiency using job scheduling techniques.
6. Implement efficient data structures, such as hash tables and balanced trees, to manage user and driver profiles, ratings, and feedback.
7. Ensure the system can handle high volumes of requests and scale effectively with increasing user base by optimizing data structures and algorithms.
8. Implement secure methods for data storage and communication to protect user and driver information.

## Applications
### Topological Sorting
This can be used to manage dependencies in the system, such as tasks that need to be completed in a specific order. For example, it could help in scheduling drivers based on a sequence of tasks that need to be completed before others.
